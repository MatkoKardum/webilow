Each task is meant to track a goal throughout its lifecycle from the moment it\'s drafted to the moment it is created in Asana.\\n\\n—How to use this workflow—\\n1. Use the Asana Form associated with this project to source goal ideas.\\n2. When a goal idea is submitted through the Asana Form, it will be created in this project as a task.\\n3. Move the goal task through each project section as needed. For example, once a goal has been drafted, move the task to the \\"Pending Approval\\" section.\\n4. When you move tasks between sections, Asana will automatically add comments and subtasks to help guide your team through the goal creation and approval process.\\n5. Once you\'re up and running, use the \\"Dashboard\\" tab to keep track of the status of your goals.\\n\\nThis workflow can be adapted to any organization\'s goals process. If you need support using this workflow, please contact your Asana representative and the Goals team will assist you.\\n\\n—Getting started—\\nTo get started, send a link to the project form so team members can begin submitting, drafting, and finalizing their goals!\\n\\n—Learn more—https://asana.com/guide/team/goal-management/leading-goals-management-process\\n\\n- Lead the goals management process: https://asana.com/guide/team/goal-management/leading-goals-management-process\\n- How to write great goals: https://asana.com/guide/team/goal-management/write-great-goals\\n- The goals management process: https://asana.com/guide/team/goal-management/write-great-goals"],"1htve7q":[0,"... will be assigned a copy",null,true],"9ams1s":[0,"... will be notified",null,true],"uu3bdh":[0,"...and more"],"wknp30":[0,"...and others."],"x1m59s":[1,{"count_one":"...and {count} more","count_other":"...and {count} more"}],"gcvhbm":[1,{"count_one":"...and {count} other","count_other":"...and {count} others"}],"zmehlm":[0,"0 days"],"v10fs6":[0,"0 hours"],"124ummz":[0,"0 milliseconds"],"1mmqyeg":[0,"0 minutes"],"2qq4cd":[0,"0 people will be notified",null,true],"ucm0d2":[0,"0 seconds"],"1ejeymy":[0,"0 weeks"],"us3dpl":[0,"0 years"],"1fo0itj":[0,"1 Day Before Event (MM/DD/YY)"],"uixvs8":[0,"1 Week"],"earkk6":[0,"1 Week After Launch"],"ouur4n":[0,"1 Week After Launch"],"f8r10g":[0,"1 Week Before Campaign"],"q1wm91":[0,"1 Week Before Campaign"],"4ubtyx":[0,"1 Week Before Event (Week of MM/DD)"],"14dwh4w":[0,"1 Week Before Fundraising Campaign Ends"],"coaibg":[0,"1 Week Before Fundraising Campaign Ends"],"xsgfnp":[0,"1 comment on an attached file"],"iy6zy9":[1,"1 comment on {fileName}"],"17halsc":[0,"1 day after"],"1jnn74h":[0,"1 day before"],"1jwttaa":[0,"1 day before event"],"ytqvw4":[0,"1 hour"],"1oi7a9m":[0,"1 hour 15 min"],"1vgp3p9":[0,"1 hour 30 min"],"1qhrti7":[0,"1 hour 45 min"],"1dorl0y":[0,"1 hour",null,true],"yjbsjy":[0,"1 hr"],"dkil84":[0,"1 month before event"],"kw761x":[0,"1 or more teams in your organization have added goals.
